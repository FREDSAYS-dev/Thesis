# Resource Support and Resource-Based Performance Analysis

## Introduction
This section provides an overview of the resource support needed for effective performance analysis. It highlights the importance of utilizing available resources to enhance performance outcomes.

## Resource Support
- Identify key resources that contribute to performance.
- Analyze the availability and accessibility of these resources.
- Develop strategies to optimize resource utilization.

## Resource-Based Performance Analysis
1. **Criteria for Evaluation**
   - Establish clear performance metrics based on resource availability.
   - Assess the impact of resource allocation on performance outcomes.
2. **Analysis Techniques**
   - Use statistical methods to analyze performance data.
   - Implement case studies to illustrate resource impacts.
3. **Recommendations**
   - Provide actionable insights based on analysis findings.
   - Suggest improvements in resource management practices.
